# LifeBot Fast LINE QA

Fast Zeabur webhook for ordinary diabetes patient-education questions.

This service answers LINE text messages directly with Gemini API and does not start
Hermes Agent. Keep Hermes Agent for scheduled diabetes news, academic search,
Obsidian/Google Drive archiving, image generation, and audio generation.

## Endpoints

- `GET /` health check
- `POST /line/webhook` LINE Messaging API webhook

## Zeabur Environment Variables

```bash
LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=...
LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
APP_VERSION=2026-04-30-ada-strict-v3
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview
GEMINI_TIMEOUT=20
LINE_TIMEOUT=12
LINE_MEMORY_ENABLED=1
LINE_CONTEXT_ENABLED=1
LINE_SESSION_SCOPE=user
LINE_CONTEXT_MAX_MESSAGES=8
LINE_CONTEXT_TTL_SECONDS=43200
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_STRICT=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR=/app/data/adaguidelines
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_SNIPPETS=3
```

Minimum variables to add or verify in Zeabur:

```bash
APP_VERSION=2026-04-30-ada-strict-v3
LINE_MEMORY_ENABLED=1
LINE_CONTEXT_ENABLED=1
LINE_SESSION_SCOPE=user
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_STRICT=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR=/app/data/adaguidelines
```

The same minimal set is also saved in `zeabur.env.example`.

`GOOGLE_API_KEY` is also accepted as a fallback. If Google AI Studio changes the
preview model name, set `GEMINI_MODEL` to the new model name in Zeabur without
changing the code.

## Background Knowledge

The webhook loads ADA Standards of Care Markdown files from `LINE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR`
and performs local file-based retrieval before each Gemini answer. This is meant
for LINE DM patient-education grounding, not for long-term user memory.

Default source inside Zeabur/container:

```text
/app/data/adaguidelines
```

Useful settings:

```bash
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_STRICT=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR=/app/data/adaguidelines
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_CHUNK_CHARS=1800
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_MAX_SNIPPETS=3
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_EXCERPT_CHARS=520
```

Health check includes `knowledge.available`, `knowledge.files`, and
`knowledge.chunks` so deployment can verify the files are mounted correctly.
For production, make sure you have permission to use the guideline files in this
kind of application and mount/copy them into the deployed service path.

### Zeabur ADA Knowledge Setup

Do not commit the full ADA Markdown files into a public GitHub repo unless you
have permission to redistribute them. Recommended deployment:

1. In Zeabur, create or attach a Volume for this service.
2. Mount it at `/app/data`.
3. Put the guideline Markdown files under `/app/data/adaguidelines`.
4. Set:

```bash
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_STRICT=1
LINE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR=/app/data/adaguidelines
```

After redeploy, `GET /` should show:

```json
"knowledge": {
  "enabled": true,
  "available": true,
  "files": 17
}
```

If `available` is `false` or `files` is `0`, the bot is running but the mounted
guideline folder is still missing or empty.

Strict mode is enabled by default. When `LINE_KNOWLEDGE_STRICT=1`, the bot only
answers from retrieved ADA guideline snippets. If the ADA knowledge base does
not contain enough relevant support, it should decline instead of using Gemini's
general medical knowledge.

## LINE User Name Memory

The webhook can remember one display name per LINE `source.userId`.
Use PostgreSQL in Zeabur by adding a PostgreSQL service and exposing
`DATABASE_URL` to this service.

Supported user commands:

```text
我叫小明
我是小明
請記住我叫小明
My name is John
I am John
Call me John
你記得我的名字嗎？
忘記我的名字
```

The bot only saves the user's display name/call name. It does not save diabetes
preferences, blood glucose values, medication, addresses, phone numbers, or
medical records. If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the service falls back to SQLite
at `LINE_MEMORY_DB` for local testing.

## Short-Term Conversation Context

The webhook can keep recent LINE messages for continuity, so follow-up questions
like `那這樣可以吃嗎？` can use the previous answer as context. This is short-term
conversation context, separate from name memory.

Default behavior:

```bash
LINE_CONTEXT_ENABLED=1
LINE_SESSION_SCOPE=user
LINE_CONTEXT_MAX_MESSAGES=8
LINE_CONTEXT_TTL_SECONDS=43200
```

This keeps the latest 8 user/bot messages for 12 hours per LINE user, group, or
room. `LINE_SESSION_SCOPE` controls the context boundary:

- `user`: one session per LINE user, even inside groups. This is the safest
  default for health questions.
- `chat`: one shared session per DM, group, or room.
- `chat_user`: one session per user inside each group or room, and one session
  per DM user.

The webhook processes one active request at a time per session key, so rapid
follow-up messages from the same session are written back in order. Different
sessions can still run concurrently in the app process.

Users can clear the current context by sending:

```text
重新開始
清除剛剛對話
清除上下文
```

## LINE Webhook URL

After Zeabur deploys this service, set the LINE webhook to:

```text
https://<your-zeabur-domain>/line/webhook
```

The previous local Hermes bridge can stay available for testing, but the fast
QA production webhook should point to this Zeabur service.

## Local Test

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8790
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8790/
```

The health check should include:

```json
{
  "app_version": "2026-04-30-ada-strict-v3",
  "features": {
    "english_name_memory": true,
    "trailing_question_removal": true,
    "short_term_context": true,
    "ada_strict_grounding": true
  }
}
```

If LINE still replies to `I am ander` with a generic diabetes answer, the deployed
service is likely still running an older build or `LINE_MEMORY_ENABLED=0`.
